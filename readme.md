# Lesson 3: Assignments | CSS Layout Design

## 1. Mastering Responsive Design with CSS Flexbox

### Objective:
I applied CSS Flexbox principles to create a flexible and adaptive web page layout.

### Task 1: Created a Basic Flexbox Layout
- Developed a simple webpage layout using Flexbox.
- Designed a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer.
- Arranged the navigation menu horizontally at the top.
- Incorporated a header with a background image and centered, bold header text in a contrasting color.
- Organized the main content with at least 2 vertically stacked child divs.
- Structured the footer with at least 3 sections arranged horizontally.

### Task 2: Implemented Responsive Design
- Utilized media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.
- Adapted the navigation and footer content areas into a column format for viewports less than 600px wide.

### Task 3: Enhanced the Layout with Flexbox Properties
- Leveraged Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-grow`.
- Ensured the main content area expanded to fill the space between the header and footer.
- Centered content within the navigation and main content areas for a balanced layout.

## 2. Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid

### Objective:
I familiarized myself with the CSS Grid layout system and applied it to create responsive web designs.

### Task 1: Created a Basic CSS Grid Layout
- Designed a straightforward web page layout using CSS Grid.
- Included a header, a main content area divided into two columns (for content and sidebar), and a footer.
- Defined the grid container and set up the grid template areas accordingly.

### Task 2: Implemented Responsive Design Using CSS Grid
- Used media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.
- Stacked the content and sidebar vertically for screens narrower than 768 pixels.

### Task 3: Advanced Grid Layout with Template Columns and Rows
- Specified column and row sizes using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.
- Experimented with fractional units (fr) and fixed sizes to create a well-balanced layout.
